It alllows to implement a 2 step navigation. By default it does not show up, after the user swipes, or clicks the `NavigationIcon` it will show the quick navigation, which\r\nonly consists out of a profile (if given), icons and badges. Users can quickly choose what they want, without interacting with any additional information. If the user wants to switch his profile, or want have access to additional\r\nfunctions, he can drag in the `MiniDrawer` and resize it to a normal `Drawer`. \r\n\r\n#Preview\r\n##Screenshots\r\n![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikepenz/CrossfadeDrawerLayout/develop/DEV/screenshots/screenshots.jpg)\r\n\r\n#Include in your project\r\n##Using Maven\r\n```javascript\r\ncompile('com.mikepenz:crossfadedrawerlayout:0.1.0@aar') {\r\n\ttransitive = true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n##How to use\r\n\r\n###With the MaterialDrawer\r\n[MaterialDrawer](https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer)\r\n```java\r\ncrossfadeDrawerLayout = new CrossfadeDrawerLayout(this);\r\n\r\n//Create the drawer\r\nresult = new DrawerBuilder()\r\n        .withActivity(this)\r\n        .withToolbar(toolbar)\r\n//provide the custom crossfadeDrawerLaoyout\r\n        .withDrawerLayout(crossfadeDrawerLayout)\r\n        .withHasStableIds(true)\r\n//define the width to the width of our smaller view\r\n        .withDrawerWidthDp(72)\r\n//generate the MiniDrawer which is used for the smaller view\r\n        .withGenerateMiniDrawer(true)\r\n//add some items, those are alo automatically added to the MiniDrawer\r\n        .addDrawerItems(\r\n                ...\r\n        )\r\n//the listener which is called when an item inside the drawer or miniDrawer is clicked\r\n        .withOnDrawerItemClickListener(new Drawer.OnDrawerItemClickListener() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public boolean onItemClick(View view, int position, IDrawerItem drawerItem) {\r\n                return false;\r\n            }\r\n        })\r\n        .withSavedInstance(savedInstanceState)\r\n        .build();\r\n\r\n//define maxDrawerWidth (this is the width in the complete opened state)\r\ncrossfadeDrawerLayout.setMaxWidthPx(DrawerUIUtils.getOptimalDrawerWidth(this));\r\n\r\n//add second view (which is the miniDrawer)\r\nMiniDrawer miniResult = result.getMiniDrawer();\r\n//build the view for the MiniDrawer\r\nView view = miniResult.build(this);\r\n//set the background of the MiniDrawer as this would be transparent\r\nview.setBackgroundColor(UIUtils.getThemeColorFromAttrOrRes(this, com.mikepenz.materialdrawer.R.attr.material_drawer_background, com.mikepenz.materialdrawer.R.color.material_drawer_background));\r\n//we do not have the MiniDrawer view during CrossfadeDrawerLayout creation so we will add it here\r\ncrossfadeDrawerLayout.getSmallView().addView(view, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT);\r\n\r\n//define the crossfader to be used with the miniDrawer.
