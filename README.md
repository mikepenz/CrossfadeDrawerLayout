#Include in your project
##Using Maven
The CrossfadeDrawerLayout Library is pushed to [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22com.mikepenz%22), so you just need to add the following dependency to your `build.gradle`.

```javascript
compile('com.mikepenz:crossfadedrawerlayout:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT@aar') {
	transitive = true
}
```

This will require the snapshot repository to be added
```gradle
maven { url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/" }
```
